This project demonstrates skills using Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQL, VS Code, and Flask. I created visuals representing weather patterns in Hawaii from various observation stations by reflecting existing data tables into SQLAlchemy ORM, and then running exploratory analysis queries to return displayable data. 

Using VS Code I created a Flask API application that can return data based on weather station, precipitation, temperature observation, or by date.
